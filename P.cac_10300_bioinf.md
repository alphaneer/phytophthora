#Phytophthora cactorum isolate 10300
==========

Scripts used for the analysis of the P. cactorum isolate 10300.
Note - all this work was performed in the directory:
/home/groups/harrisonlab/project_files/idris
. As such this script relies upon adhering to a 
specific directory structure.

The following is a summary of the work presented in this Readme.

The following processes were applied to Alternaria genomes prior to analysis:
Data qc
Genome assembly
Repeatmasking
Gene prediction
Functional annotation

Analyses performed on these genomes involved BLAST searching for:
Known Avr genes
Ab initio prediction of putative RxLR, CRN and SSC effectors.
Upregulated genes during an RNAseq timecourse.




#Data qc

programs:
  fastqc
  fastq-mcf
  kmc

Data quality was visualised using fastqc:
```shell
	for RawData in raw_dna/paired/P.cactorum/10300/*/*.fastq*?; do 
		ProgDir=/home/armita/git_repos/emr_repos/tools/seq_tools/dna_qc
		echo $RawData; 
		qsub $ProgDir/run_fastqc.sh $RawData
	done
```

Trimming was performed on data to trim adapters from 
sequences and remove poor quality data. This was done with fastq-mcf

```shell
	for StrainPath in raw_dna/paired/P.cactorum/10300; do 
		ProgDir=/home/armita/git_repos/emr_repos/tools/seq_tools/rna_qc
		IlluminaAdapters=/home/armita/git_repos/emr_repos/tools/seq_tools/illumina_full_adapters.fa
		ReadsF=$(ls $StrainPath/F/*.fastq*)
		ReadsR=$(ls $StrainPath/R/*.fastq*)
		echo $ReadsF
		echo $ReadsR
		qsub $ProgDir/rna_qc_fastq-mcf.sh $ReadsF $ReadsR $IlluminaAdapters DNA
	done
```

Data quality was visualised once again following trimming:
```shell
	for RawData in qc_dna/paired/P.cactorum/10300/*.fastq*; do 
		ProgDir=/home/armita/git_repos/emr_repos/tools/seq_tools/dna_qc
		echo $RawData; 
		qsub $ProgDir/run_fastqc.sh $RawData
	done
```

kmer counting was performed using kmc
This allowed estimation of sequencing depth and total genome size

```shell
	for TrimPath in qc_dna/paired/P.cactorum/10300; do 
		ProgDir=/home/armita/git_repos/emr_repos/tools/seq_tools/dna_qc
		TrimF=$(ls $TrimPath/F/*.fastq*)
		TrimR=$(ls $TrimPath/R/*.fastq*)
		echo $TrimF
		echo $TrimR
		qsub $ProgDir/kmc_kmer_counting.sh $TrimF $TrimR
	done
```
